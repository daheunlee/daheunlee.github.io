*Hi-Chew* is a candy that you could find in most, if not **all**, Asian grocery stores. It comes in bright and colorful packaging, has a variety of different flavors, and is an overall addicting candy to consume. Most may think that *Hi-Chew's* are just like any other gummy candies out there, however, it was in fact created as a type of gum you are meant to swallow. 


## Humble Beginnings
Born in 1865, Taichiro Morinaga came from very little. He grew up without the privilege of having an education and was only seven years old when he lost his father. Morinaga was only 23 when he had moved to the States with the sole pupose of figuring out what he wanted to do with his life. His life changed when a stranger offered him his first ever piece of candy. Taking what he learned in the states, he was inspired to create and sell his own candy back in his home country of Japan. Over the span of 20 years, Morinaga was able to successfully establish his own company which continues to sell some of Asia's most popular treats. 

## Edible Gum
In 1956, his company, **Morinaga & Company**, created their idea of edible gum called *Chewlets*. It came in one flavor (strawberry) and it was meant to resemble that of gum except it would slowly dissolve which meant you would not have to take it back out of your mouth to dispose of. Fast forward to 1975, *Chewlets* were rebranded to the *Hi-Chew* candy we know today.
